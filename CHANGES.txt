0.3.4
======
 * Fixed some thread synchronization issues.
 * Improved long polling performance for threaded channels. 

0.3.3
======
 * Allow Target objects to return twisted.defer.Deferred objects when using TwistedChannel.
 * Eliminated Channel.max_interval. Set Channel.wait_interval to a non-zero value instead.
 * Ignore 0x11 AMF3 marker byte during AMF3 decoding. 

0.3.2
======
 * Added http long-polling and http streaming channels.

0.3.1
======
 * Added ez_setup.py script for installing uuid.

0.3.0
======

remoting
---------
 * Producer/Consumer messaging via HTTP polling.
 * Channels and ChannelSets allow resources to be exposed in multiple ways.
 * Built in Channels for CherryPy, Twisted Web, and straight-up WSGI.
 * Easy to configure authentication for NetConnection and RemoteObject.
 * Connection objects hold session attributes tied to Flex client id.
 * Customizable Endpoints to encode/decode messages with external encoding/decoding libraries.
 * PyAmfEndpoint to encode/decode messages with pure Python, with no C compiler dependencies.

encode/decode
--------------
 * Read and write to file-like-objects or strings (using strings is much faster).
 * Automatic type conversion:
     * Use amfast.class_def.ClassDef.encode_types to convert object attributes to custom types before encoding.
     * Use amfast.class_def.ClassDef.decode_types to convert object attribute to custom types after decoding.
 * amfast.class_def.as_types.AsProxy and amfast.class_def.as_types.AsNoProxy allow overriding 
     'use_collections' and 'use_proxies' settings for a individual objects.
 * readExternal and writeExternal methods of the IEXTERNALIZABLE interface accept different parameters
     to make custom encodings easier.
 * amfast.encoder.Encoder and amfast.decoder.Decoder:
     Wrappers around amfast.encode and amfast.decode, so you don't need to pass the same arguments every
     time you encode or decode.
